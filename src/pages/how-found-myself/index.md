So my journey to becoming a developer is pretty strange compared to the usual stories you hear. All because i got my first developer job in 5 months.

Contrary to what you think, i wasn't a web developer in high-school, i was actually a java nerd. YES! i know what you're thinking. That's way too short of time to a get a web developer job. But the truth is, i got it on somewhat luck and the fact that i already understood the fundamentals of programming.

And those fundamentals helped so much more than you'd think. So straight after graduating, i decided to delve in web development after hearing a little more about it from a close friend. The strangest part of this journey was that i never enjoyed web development when i first started. It felt over-complicated and unnecessary but the more i built, the more i realised how powerful it was. I could dream of an idea and the next day, bring that dream to reality. That amazement still drives me to this day and i hope i can inspire that childish wonder to you too.

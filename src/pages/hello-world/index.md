This is the first post on my new blog! So let's get some things straight.

I realise alot of devs like to write blogs (who doesn't have a blog these days). But here's the thing, this blog is here to get some insight into a working dev's lifestyle so if you're the curious type or if you wanna become a dev yourself. I'm sure you'll find some value here.

For those of you who don't know what i do, here's a quick little introduction. So my name is Robert and i'm a software engineer. At the moment, i'm working with React to create some amazing products for VR that i would love to show you some day. But for now, feel free to explore a-little more and go read the next post(hopefully it'll be up before you read this).

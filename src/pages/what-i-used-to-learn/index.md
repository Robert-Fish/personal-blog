While other devs are familiar with using courses to learn new technologies(frameworks, libraries) from Udemy or Coursera. I mostly used documentation to learn new concepts and it was one of the best decisions i've ever made in my career. Now i know documentation can be really intimidating to new devs and it was to me too. But pushing through, i learnt how to read documentation and understand the technology from the devs perspective.

It was definitely challenging and annoying at times but it taught me important lessons. It taught me how to develop in an industry that requires alot of persistence and patience. I thought i would write a short blog up this week since i'm off from work and i've started a youtube channel. If you wanna check it out then feel free to at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChPhsHPTmwtjOtR9OOBZ94g

See you next time! ðŸ˜ƒ

One of the questions i constantly get asked is my work environment and today, i think is the best time to tell you.

So to get some background information out of the way. I work for a VR company(cool, right?) and here we use the modern MERNG stack along with GraphQL and Apollo.

Now these are pretty new technologies and alot of older companies tend to use older, legacy stacks but since we're such a young company. We've had the ability to build our entire infrastructure on a modern stack. In my case, i use this entire stack everyday since i'm a full-stack engineer so i handle both our front-end and back-end services.

With this stack, it's given us alot of flexibility with how we add and remove services to our infrastructure which gives me maximum flexibility at work. With that said, i would love to tell you more but it''s now to time to leave so until we meet again. I leave you with this, build your apps on a stack that works. Not a stack you love.
